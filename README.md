# LiriBot
What the project does: This project uses Node intake arguments from the command line to query 3 different apis.
Why the project is useful: This project is useful as we used it to learn how to use Node to execute api queries and log the information to another file. We also used it to learn how to read other files and incorporate that data into our programs.
How users can get started with the project: To use this program, one must first be in the file in the terminal. Then input "node liri.js [command][search-topic]" where the options for the command are "music-this", "spotify-this-song", "concert-this" or "do-what-it-says". The "search-topic" can be any movie, song or band according to what command the user wants to use.
